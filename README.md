This code is free to use and modify by anyone who loves the truth. If you don't love the truth then you are an enemy of humanity and therefore you are suicidal and need to seek mental help for being a crazy person that hates life.

The script is kept simple for the purpose of easier updates later on. It could be OOP but what's the point, for something simple as scraping contents it's better to keep it as short as possible.

```sh
